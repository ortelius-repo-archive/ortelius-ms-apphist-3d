Use index.html file to run 3D Bar Chart.

The sample data is in `/data/input_data.json`. 
The Data in sample json file is only sufficient for atmost 4 Component and 7 Dataset. If you want to run with more component or dataset, update the file with more data or feed the data using the API.

# The contract for the input data

```

  "graphDetails": {
    "axisStep": <steps between two bars: Int>,
    "noOfComponents": <number of component: Int>,
    "noOfDetasetPerComponent": <number of dataset per component: Int>,
    "style": <style of graph: String>,
    "color": <colors for components: Array<String>>,

  },
